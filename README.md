Hi,

I made this little setup document to help with any kind of issues that might occur during setup.

**Prerequisites:**

- **[Java Development Kit (JDK):](https://www.oracle.com/java/)**  
  Ensure you have JDK installed. You can [download](https://www.oracle.com/java/) and install it from the Oracle website or use OpenJDK.

- **[Maven:](https://maven.apache.org/)**  
  Install Maven to manage the project's build. You can [download](https://maven.apache.org/) it from the Apache Maven website and follow the installation instructions.

- **Chrome WebDriver:**  
  Download the Chrome WebDriver compatible with your Chrome browser version. Ensure the WebDriver version matches your Chrome browser version.  
  - Ensure your Chrome browser is installed and up to date.
  - Verify the compatibility between Chrome WebDriver and the [Chrome browser version](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
  - Make sure the necessary dependencies are resolved by Maven during the build process.
  - Modify the `CHROME_DRIVER_PATH` accordingly if you're using a different operating system or if the WebDriver is placed in a different location.

I hope you enjoy,

Fabio Ghetler
